# Pavarotti

‚Äé‚ÄèHola!

Hope you‚Äôre have a good day, **Project-Manager was extremely quiet, super-busy.. as usual**,
But that did not prevent us from continuing our march of excellence!


‚Äé‚ÄèInstead of a long introduction, What is that, and how I use it?

## What is that?

A simple package that deals with localization stuff, and with easy-way to use, with only a few lines of code, but behind those lines, there is a lot of magic. ‚ú®

## How to use it?: 

It's simple, add the package via Swift package manager.

```swift
https://github.com/shadyelmaadawy/Pavarotti.git
```

Okay, now inherit our view controller in your class, 

```swift
import Pavarotti

class ViewController: PavarottiViewController {

}
```

Okay, how do make It support multiple languages?, the traditional way, create a localizable strings file and link it to your project,

And with the key you had put in the file, add it via storyboard, xib, or your programmatic UI!

Mission accomplished dude!

--------
If you want to change active language, you can easily via shared instance, also it supports changing the whole views without restarting the application.

```swift
import Pavarotti

    func setActiveLanguage() {
        let languageCode = "ar"
        Pavarotti.shared.setActiveLanguage(with: languageCode) 
    }
```

There is a project as an example that you can understand the package from it.

## PoC:

## Road-Map:
- [ ] Add support to more UIKit UI controls such as UITabBarController... etc
- [ ] Add support to AppKit and OSX
- [ ] Add Support to SwiftUI
- [ ] Enhance the codebase all the way.

## To Infinity and beyond!

This package is still in beta release, and will be supported because I want to use it in a lot of projects, If you find any bug, don't hesitate to report it, with all my love.. ZzZzZzZzZzZzZ
